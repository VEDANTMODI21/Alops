#Open OnDemand Docker Setup
## ✅ Current Status

- ✔️ Removed system folders (`usr/`, `lib/`, `tmp/`, etc.) and large binary files
- ✔️ Clean `.gitignore` applied to avoid pushing unwanted files
- ✔️ Project structure cleaned to retain only app and Docker-related files
- ❌ No system libraries or runtime files in repo (to comply with GitHub size limits)

## 🚧 Upcoming Work

- ✨ Add custom HTML login page for Open OnDemand
- 🎨 Improve UI design for a more user-friendly login and dashboard
- 🔄 Re-commit updated app with frontend changes

## 🔁 To Do

- [ ] Add `Dockerfile` for repeatable build
- [ ] Add `docker-compose.yml` (optional)
- [ ] Upload frontend (HTML/CSS) after styling is done
- [ ] Add documentation for setting up Open OnDemand in Docker
